# Tic-Tac-Toe in Kotlin 🎮

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, crafted in Kotlin as part of the JetBrains Academy curriculum. 🎓

## Description 📝

This program allows two players to engage in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe within their console. The game unfolds on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns placing their marks (X and O) in empty cells. The first player to achieve three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal emerges victorious! 🏆

## Features ✨

*  Full-fledged Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation.
*  Console-based user interface for easy interaction.
*  Robust input validation to ensure smooth gameplay.
*  Accurate detection of winning conditions and draws.

## How to Run 🚀

1. Ensure you have the Kotlin JDK installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Compile and execute the `Main.kt` file.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. The program will present an empty 3x3 grid. // Can change it
2. Players alternate turns, entering the coordinates of the cell where they wish to place their mark.
3. Coordinates should be entered in the format "row column" (e.g., "1 2").
4. The game persists until one player wins or a draw occurs.


## Future Enhancements 💡

*  Develop an AI opponent for single-player mode. 🤖
*  Enhance the user interface for a more engaging experience.
*  Introduce the option to play on grids of varying sizes.
